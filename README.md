**Delivery**  
You are tasked with delivering a highly confidential mail, but you have lost the exact location of the apartment in the building. In order to find the right apartment, you need to knock on doors and gather clues or directions from the building’s occupants. However, be careful as some of the occupants may be dangerous and could attack you. These dangerous individuals can be found both behind the doors and on various floors of the building.

Your ultimate objective is to deliver the mail before getting knocked out by any of the dangerous individuals.


**Controls**  
Press “A”, “W”, or “D” to move around.
